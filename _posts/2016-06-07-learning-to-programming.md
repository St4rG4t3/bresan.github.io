Many friends of mine come to me asking for advice about how to start programming, or in some cases, how to proceed after their first "Hello World" *(yeah, all of us feel excitement after we run our first Hello World, come on)*.

The main purpose of this post is to give advices and resources to anyone who is interested in this journey of learning, whatever reason motivates you, professionally or just by hobby, and what are the main things you must keep in mind when learning and practicing new things when it comes to software development.

## A simple analogy

Let's say that you want to learn how to cook. In this post, if this were a blog related to culinary, I would recommend you many books about recipes you would probably enjoy cooking. You would probably do many of these recipes successfully, with many positive feedbacks from another people - of course, if you had followed the recipes instructions correctly. But, if you want to change something in the recipe, or if some ingredient is missing, what are you supposed to do without knowing what was happening inside the head of who write the recipe?

This is the concept we are going to see in this post, through the following comparison: the act of following a set of instructions **versus** the act of understand the theory behind it. In the software development world, we can follow this comparison too, just by comparing the act of programming **versus** the act of understand the theory behind the program.

It's very common to find resources with the promise of teach some topic in a short time of time, like the series "Learn *[insert_here_the_language]* in 21 days". These kind of material, while present the main concepts of the language, can lead to us to a wrong understanding about what really is the act of programming.

A software developer is not only someone which knows one or many programming languages; a software developer is someone that in the search for the **answer of a problem**, uses these many programming languages and tools, and understand how all these resources he has can work together to solve his problem.

**And this is it what we do everyday: solve problems**

So this is my advice for beginners: focus on the ability to solve problems, instead of learning x programming languages and n frameworks.

## Real world problems

On our everyday lives, we face many situations where we need to take actions for their accomplishments. You can think in many of these situations, since the act of brushing your teeth, open a door, clean a room, drive, by many others. All these activities are made by many steps that together, accomplish the activity.

This is the main philosophy a software developer must have in his mind is the **act of divide some activity into steps**, or in other words, decompose the problem in small parts.

As example, we can decompose the act of making an apple pie:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.
2. Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.
3. Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.

Above we can see all the steps needed to do our apple pie. If we can fully understand these steps, as well as the theory behind it, we can change our apple pie to anything we want - like a banana pie.

This is a good point by one point of view, since it allows us to reuse something already made and tested by another person, but by another point of view it hides from us how that sequence of steps in that way produces that result **(here applies the theory)**. Also, if we need to change something in our recipe, we can have many nightmares if we don't understand each step by itself.

The main point I want to advice you in this section, is to learn how to solve problems, as well as decompose them into steps. The ability of decompose a problem in small steps, and these small steps in another ones  is what a software developer does on its everyday. The main reason of this it's because we, as humans beings, have a hard time when it comes to keeping all these steps like a single one in our head, making it easier when we decompose it in many small steps.

## Learn programming

To start learn programming, you will need first to choose a programming language. I personally advice you to go with Python or Ruby, since they have an easy learning curve, as well as some excellent documentation and community. Both of these languages serve on the main purposes of development, since simple scripts, web applications and mobile apps.

You can find many websites with study guides for these languages, such as the CodeCademy and the CodeSchool, websites which focuses is to teach programming languages in an interactive way, mainly by solving problems using the languages. Below you can find the links for these websites.

[Learn Ruby on CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby)

You can find many other resources for learning in sites like Udacity and Coursera, which have stuff related to the main concepts of computer science, as shown below:

# Learn to debug your code

An important step for learning how to program is surely know what is happening inside your code, and that's the purpose of debugging your code. When debugging, you can see the values of the fields/variables, called methods, call hierarchy and everything else that happens on your program lifecycle. The act of debugging your code is a valuable tool to see what your code is doing and look previously for any existent bugs.

# Learn to look for solutions

Its unbelievable how much resources are available about programming, most of them related to to troubleshooting. Learn to search for solutions on the main communities of developers, like StackOverflow. It's going to be like a guru to you when you have no idea about what is wrong in your code - *and believe me, it's going to happen a lot of times*.

## Learn the core concepts of computer science

After you got some basic knowledge about how solve problems, as well as learning some programming language, an important step, most of times lacked, is learning about the core concepts of computer science. Learn about the many ways of store data (lists, stacks and queues), sorting algorithms (quick sort, merge sort, heap sort), data structures (binary trees, red-black trees, hash tables), and Big O.

These topics listed above are the core of computer science, and are a lot requested during interviews (!).

## Read code written by others

Read code is what a developer most does in their everyday live as professional, as said by Uncle Bob (Robert C. Martin):

> “Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly reading old code as part of effort to write new code…[Therefore,] making it easy to read makes it easier to write” – Uncle Bob

By the quote above, we can learn that the act of reading code has a giant paper on our journey to learn how to become better software developers. There are many communities of open source code with lots of projects ready to be read and have your contribution. One of most popular of these communities is [GitHub](http://github.com), a social platform focused on open source projects, which uses the Git versioning system (I'll be creating a post explaining how it works later).

The good point of read and contribute on open source projects is that many of these already an substantial volume of code, which will be pretty good for you, since in our everyday lives as programmers, it's pretty common to work on huge projects.

## Start programming!

The key factor for learn programming is through programming by yourself.

Pick some idea *(since calculate the media of a sequence of values until finding the nearest bathroom)*, being this one simple or complex, and just do it. Start with something simple, and with the time, evolve it. Don't forget to contribute with your idea on open source communities (like GitHub), so people can give you feedback about it.

## Join some community

The number of communities focused on software development it's increasing everyday. You can find groups about any kind of topic on the most different platforms of communication, such as the [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com), a website based on the Questions & Answers model, as well as the [Quora](http://quora.com), similar to the StackOverflow. Another popular communities are the [Facebook](http://facebook.com) with it's groups and the [Slack](http://slack.com) with it's many channels, similar to mIRC.

## Find a mentor

One of the greatest advices I can give to you here is to find a mentor.

But.. what is a mentor? A mentor is the guy who once was like you, so he will guide you through this process of learning, showing to you which paths you can take and the consequences of your choices.

*"Alright, I want a mentor, where should I look for one?"*, you ask. Well, when looking for a mentor, you must follow the single rule for finding one:

**Rule 1: To find a mentor, don't look for one**

Looks contradictory, doesn't? But this is how it works. It will be hard, if not impossible, to find a mentor just by looking for one. The best way to find one, is to become a better software developer. Write code, contribute on open source projects and go to meetups and events related to programming. This way, you will be with people that share the same mindset than you, and then it will be easy to find someone to guide you in this journey.

## Events

Events are also an important thing for developers, mainly when it comes to the career. Events are a nice place for talking about an specific topic with people that are interested in the same things that you are. One major point is also the networking that events can allow you to have.

## Bootcamps

Boootcamps are a great way to increase your experience and knowledge in a fast and solid way, since they are based of many meetups focusing on the learning and application of some technology (language, framework, etc).

Some popular bootcamps can be found below:

**App Academy:** Bootcamp focused on Software engineering with 3 months duration. It doesn't charge you nothing until you find a job as developer.

**Viking Code School:** Remote bootcamp focused on web development. Free of charge until you find a job.

**HackReactor:** Remote and often in presence bootcamp focused on web development, as well some concepts of computer science.

**Hack Bright:** Focused on the woman public with interest in software development.

# Final notes

With this guide, I hope help anyone who is looking for how to enter in the software development world, as well to give advices for those who already have some knowledge about it. In case of any question, feel free to ask :-)

## See you later and have fun programming!
